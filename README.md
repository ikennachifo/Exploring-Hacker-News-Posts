# Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project, I'll work with a data set of submissions to the popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

In this project, I'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts I'll explore begin with either AskHN or ShowHN.

---

Users submit AskHN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit ShowHN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

I'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

    Do AskHN or ShowHN receive more comments on average?
    Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
